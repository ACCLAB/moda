    "text": "Question 4: how do we concisely describe the penguin dataset?\n(Or, dimension reduction with Principle Component Analysis)\nFor this we go back to the origianl metrics including all lengths and body mass. We have 4 dimensions we measured the penguins on, and their relationship with each other is a little complex. Many of the metrics are correlated with each other, indicating redudancy between them. What if we want a more concise way of describing the data? We can try to reduce the dimensions to fewer that are orthogonal to each other, along the first of which the data has the most variance.\nRead more about PCA here\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition  import PCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npenguins_dropna = penguins.dropna()\nX = penguins_dropna[[\"bill_length_mm\",  \"bill_depth_mm\",    \"flipper_length_mm\", \"body_mass_g\"]] \nY = penguins_dropna[\"species\"] \nscaler = StandardScaler() # Create a StandardScaler object.\nscaler.fit(X) # Fit the StandardScaler object to the data.\nX_scaled = scaler.transform(X) # Generating a matrix with standardized values (z-scores). Z-scores allow us to compare all the metrics on the same scale.\n\nFirst we generate all the principle components we can, in this case it is 4, and we check the explanatory power of including more and more of them.\n\npca4 = PCA(n_components=4)\npca4.fit(X_scaled)\nf = plt.plot(pca4.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum(), \"o-\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Principal Components\");\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative Explained Variance Ratio\");\nplt.title(\"Scree Plot of Penguin Measurements\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that 2 components explain vast majority of the variance. So we are going to plot our original data into the PC1 v PC2 space. Now let’s project the data into this new, more concise space.\n\npca2 = PCA(n_components=2)\npca2.fit(X_scaled)\nPCs = pca2.fit_transform(X_scaled)\nX_scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns = [\"bill_length_mm\",   \"'bill_depth_mm\",   \"flipper_length_mm\", \"body_mass_g\"])\nPCs_df = pd.DataFrame(PCs, columns = [\"PC1\", \"PC2\"])\npenguins_pca = pd.concat([X_scaled_df, Y, PCs_df], axis = 1)\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize = (5, 5))\nsns.scatterplot(x=PCs[:, 0], y=PCs[:, 1], hue=Y, alpha = 0.7)\nax.set_xlabel(\"PC1\");\nax.set_ylabel(\"PC2\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, PC1 and PC2 are linear combinations of the original metrics. We also want to know how much of each of the original metrics contribute to each of the PCs. We calculate a loading matrix for this puropse.\n\nloading_matrix = pd.DataFrame(pca2.components_.T, columns = [\"PC1\", \"PC2\"], index = [\"bill_length_mm\",  \"'bill_depth_mm\",   \"flipper_length_mm\", \"body_mass_g\"])\n\nf = sns.heatmap(loading_matrix, cmap=\"coolwarm\", annot=True)\nplt.title(\"Heatmap of Loading Matrix\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that PC1 is mostly coming from filpper length and body mass, and PC2 is mostly coming from bill depth.",

From this link:\n\nThe name has its origins in a few different places. First, the names comes from the planet Jupiter. We wanted to pick a name that evoked the traditions and ideas of science. Second, the core programming languages supported by Jupyter are Julia, Python and R. While the name Jupyter is not a direct acronym for these languages, it nods its head in those directions. In particular, the “y” in the middle of Jupyter was chosen to honor our Python heritage. Third, Galileo was the first person to discover the moons of Jupiter. His publication on the moons of Jupiter is an early example of research that includes the underlying data in the publication.

The multivariate dataset includes characteristics of the penguins including species and sex, body size measurements such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length and body mass, as well as location and year of measurements.

Nightingale used this visualization to illustrate how poor conditions were killing more soldiers than battle itself, thereby convincing military officials to improve sanitation in army hospitals.
