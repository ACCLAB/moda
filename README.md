### Introducing biomedical scientists to data analysis with Python

The goal of this class is to introduce biomedical scientists to data
analysis with Python notebooks. Ideally, this should be a semester-long
course. This 2-hour class is presented to two groups.

- Duke-NUS PhD programme in Clinical and Translational Sciences.
  Foundations of Precision Medicine Hands-on Workshops (GMS6812).
- Duke-NUS PhD programme in Integrated Biology and Medicine. Ethics and
  Personal and Professional Development Sessions.

### The class has the following steps

1.  **Preparation 1.** Read the [Introduction](introduction.html) and
    install the prerequisite software on your laptop.
2.  **Preparation 2.** Go through a [Quick Tour of the
    Notebook](quick_tour_of_the_notebook.html) to familiarise yoruself
    to the jupyter notebook environment.
3.  **Session Coding.** Bring your laptop to class, and we will go
    through the examples in [Data Analysis with
    Jupyter](data_analysis_with_jupyter_and_python.html).
4.  **Lecture.** Crash course on the history of and key issues in data
    visualization.
5.  **Short introduction to estimation and LLMs.** Introduction to
    estimation statistics [web app](https://www.estimationstats.com/#/)
    and [python package](dabest_introduction.html).
6.  **Continuing education.** Review the Additional Resources page to
    continue your self-education in data analysis.
