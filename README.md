  Personal and Professional Development Sessions.

The goal of this class is to introduce biomedical scientists to data
analysis with Python notebooks. Ideally, this should be a semester-long
course, but has been limited to this 2-hour class.

The class has the following steps:

    Notebook](quick_tour_of_the_notebook.html) to familiarise yoruself
    to the jupyter notebook environment.
3.  **Session Coding.** Bring your laptop to class, and we will go
    through the examples in [Data Analysis with
    Jupyter](data_analysis_with_jupyter_and_python.html).
4.  **Lecture.** Crash course on the history of and key issues in data
    visualization.
5.  **Short introduction to estimation and LLMs.** Introduction to
    estimation statistics [web app](https://www.estimationstats.com/#/)
    and [python package](dabest_introduction.html).
