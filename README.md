analysis with Python notebooks. There are two parts to the session: a
lecture on the key issues in data analysis and a hands-on tutorial.
Please do the following preparations before class.

    prerequisite software on your laptop.
2.  Go through a [Quick Tour of the
    Notebook](quick_tour_of_the_notebook.html) to familiarise yoruself
    to the jupyter notebook environment.
3.  Bring your laptop to class, and we will go through the examples in
    [Data Analysis with
    Jupyter](data_analysis_with_jupyter_and_python.html).

If we have more time in class, you will also be introduced to our
estimation statistics package [DABEST
